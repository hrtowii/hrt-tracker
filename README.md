# hrt tracker
# (planned) features
* localstorage, or some simple shared one you can copy / save across browsers. no login that's not the point ✅
* set reminders for taking hrt? but not really ideal as it's a website ❌
* simplest part:
	* enter → get asked to put in current dosage, past blood results (or import) - partial
	* ask if you wanna set up a tracker → track various configurable things ❌
	* if not, simple mode -
		* you just input whether injected / oral ✅
			* → time of ingestion / injection and type of hormone. ev oral? injected? hemihydrate? ✅
* change in graphs overtime for trackable stuff ✅
